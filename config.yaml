    subtitle: "Following my baccalaureate, I decided to pursue a 4-year degree at Imperial College London in Electronics and Computer Science. \n After a first experience in Bouygues Telecom (French carier), 
    I joinded AlixPartners as a strategy consultant, where I was first introduced to finance and its highly intebnse atmosphere. \n It was great but not technical enough for me, hence the next year I joined BNP Paribas in their Risk Division. \n
    Finally, I joined Ardian as a Private Equity intern and loved it, motivating me to work in Corporate Finance.\n, After a brieve attempt to launch my start-up I am looking for new experiences :)"
