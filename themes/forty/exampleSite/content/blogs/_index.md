Our high-tech Water Sensors takes constant measurements and sends them to our RaspberryPi processing unit.

The processing unit correlates and organises the measurements, and sends them off to our cloud database via secure HTTPS.

Our Cloud server uses cutting-edge machine learning and artificial intelligence to process the measurements, which it then makes available on the ThinkTank WebApp.
